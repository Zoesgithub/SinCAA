## 🚀 Overview
![Overview of SinCAA](figs/fig1.png)
Standard protein language models are typically trained only on canonical amino acids, which limits their capacity to model peptides containing ncAAs.
This project introduces SinCAA, a framework that integrates a 3D conformational similarity metric into a graph transformer trained with dual objectives—contrastive learning and masked-node reconstruction—to generate transferable molecular embeddings capable of generalizing from individual ncAAs to complete peptides.
SinCAA demonstrates strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, including peptide binding affinity prediction, cell-penetrating ability estimation, and protein–peptide binding site prediction. Notably, it achieves substantial improvements over existing methods and exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization, underscoring its potential to accelerate therapeutic peptide discovery.

## 🔥 Quick start
To ensure reproducibility, all dependencies required for SinCAA can be installed via the provided environment.yml file.
Follow the steps below to create and activate the environment.

` conda env create -f environment.yml ; conda activate sincaa `

SinCAA relies on [OpenFold](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold) for feature extraction. Please follow the official OpenFold installation instructions to install it properly.

The pretrained weights for SinCAA are available at:
` data/results/n1_weight0.1_innl2_both/`

To generate embeddings for peptides or amino acids from a CSV file containing molecular representations in the SMILES column, execute the following command:

``` 
python -m Tools.generate_emb_from_smiles \
    --csv_path path_to_file.csv \
    --pretrained_dir data/results/n1_weight0.1_innl2_both/ \
    --save_dir save_path.npy 
```


Here:
* --csv_path specifies the path to the input CSV file (e.g., data/examples/exam_csv.csv).

* --pretrained_dir provides the directory containing the pretrained SinCAA model weights.

* --save_dir defines the output path for saving the generated embeddings in NumPy format (.npy)

### Usage
#### Model Training

Download the ZINC15 10M dataset from the official website. Split the training and validation datasets:

`python scripts/split_data.py path_to_zinc_data`


Start model training:

`bash scripts/train.sh`

#### Similarity Calculation

To calculate the similarity between a pair of non-canonical amino acids A and B:

```
from utils.similarity_utils import get_space_distance

grid_size = 1        # Recommended values: 0.5, 1, or 2
num_samples = 20     # Recommended: 20 or higher

similarity = get_space_distance(A, B, grid_size, num_samples=num_samples)
print(similarity)
```

#### Downstream Applications
